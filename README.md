## Hosted Web Core Bootstrapper

Bootstraps an IIS based application using Hosted Web Core.

Needs to be run with administrator privileges in order to run properly. 

All third party dependencies are embeded into main executable via Costura.Fody - all that is required to deploy is the main executable.

With :heart: from @mxplusb & @macsux.
